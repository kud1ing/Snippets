* make sure that [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) is installed
* make sure that [webpack](https://webpack.js.org) is installed
* transpile the TypeScript code to JavaScript code with `tsc`
* bundle the JavaScript files as `dist/result.js` with `npx webpack --config webpack.config.js`
* make sure that [local file restrictions are disabled](https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2014/08/bypass-cors-errors-testing-apis-locally/) in your web browser
* open `index.html` in that web browser and observe the console logging
